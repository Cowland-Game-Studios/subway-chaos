# Subway Chaos
## What is this thing

On Junly 31, 2018, Cowland Game Studios released a game by the title of *Subway Chaos:Manhattan* on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/237168844/). At the time, it was just a side project and only took two days of summer to make. We had big amitions for this project, but **due to the lack of proper graphics and game design**, not many people played it, and even less people **enjoyed** it. 

As a result of its lack of publicity, future updates were scrapped. However,at the time, we had plans to make a better version, called Airport Chaos where the location would be set in Paris, and MrMoooo would also incorperate the Chaosâ„¢ franchise into his games too.
